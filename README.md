# Hipparchus
New Perspectives on JavaScript and AJAX
 Hipparchus
Alexis Richards manages a Web site named Hipparchus that contains articles and a discussion forum for people 
who share her interest in amateur astronomy. You have already helped Alexis set up her Web site and add new features. 
Now she wants you to create an interactive image gallery and slide show for users who want to view images from astronomy and space science.
Alexis doesnâ€™t want to purchase a commercial product to manage her images. Instead, you will use JavaScript to write an image gallery 
and slide show application.The program you write should be flexible and easily adapted to any page on her Web site.
She also wants to be able to use the program without having to greatly modify the HTML code already written for her Web pages.
